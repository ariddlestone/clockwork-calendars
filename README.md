This Zend Framework 2 module provides interfaces and controllers for viewing calendars, although how those calendars are
stored is left to other modules.

See
[https://github.com/ariddlestone/clockwork-calendars-doctrine](Doctrine Calendars) or
[https://github.com/ariddlestone/clockwork-calendars-zend-db](Zend DB Calendars) for implementations.
