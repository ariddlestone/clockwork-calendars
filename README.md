This Zend Framework 2 module provides interfaces and controllers for viewing calendars, although how those calendars are
stored is left to other modules.

See
[iCalendar Calendars](https://github.com/ariddlestone/clockwork-calendars-icalendar),
[Doctrine Calendars](https://github.com/ariddlestone/clockwork-calendars-doctrine), or
[Zend DB Calendars](https://github.com/ariddlestone/clockwork-calendars-zend-db) for implementations.
